# Using Cohere's Generate AI model!

This project allows for the user to input a subject matter in the input field and the output will be a poem.

# How Its Made 
Tech used: React, Tailwind CSS and Cohere Generate AI

# Lessons Learned
During this process I learned more about state management with handling components, React Router and hosting on Netlify through their CLI tool. This was a very interesting journey with times where it wasn't making sense why certain components were outputting when they shouldn't be, how to pass data being received from the AI model to the client. Used lots more of conditional rendering to only be outputting the elements wanted.


# Optimizations
- teach a data model how to only output 4 line poems each and everytime, giving the user the option to input only the subject matter for ex. "trees"
- separate components into separate files to add a better structure to the project
- authentication, give a user the ability to login and logout, having the poems that generated saved to their profile, if wanting to come back to them
